This is the code that runs an example from Ball et al 2021 https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.171918
Data also on FigShare: https://figshare.com/s/fe0eb801ed18691439ea
Git not fully ready yet. But this should work!

rbj_gan_toon_Git1.ipynb runs two channel input....
Numan_conv1d_gan.py runs just for one channel (typically raw data)....
